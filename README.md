# My Portfolio

## About The Project

This project aims to create a portfolio website as a way to introduce my professional experience and background as a software developer
and computer engineer. I believe that as perfect as Github is, its not as expressive as a portfolio. This portfolio is also a project to 
further develop my skills as a software developer particularly in Django, specifically to further practice software development design
patterns including Clean Code, Django Forms, Filters and Pagination. 

## Key Features
* CkEditor
