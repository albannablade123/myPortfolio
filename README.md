# My Portfolio

## About The Project

This project aims to create a portfolio website as a way to introduce my professional experience and background as a software developer
and computer engineer. I believe that as perfect as Github is, its not as expressive as a portfolio. This portfolio is also a project to 
further develop my skills as a software developer particularly both in Django for the functionalities of the application and HTML and CSS for the design of the projct. Additionally, the project helps further practice my skill in software development design
patterns including Clean Code, Django Forms, Filters and Pagination.
